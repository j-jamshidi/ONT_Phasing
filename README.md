The primary purpose of this code is to enable the phasing of two variants using Nanopore long-read sequencing while reporting potentially chimeric reads. This code was specifically developed to facilitate the calculation of chimeric reads based on just two variants. Chimeric reads, which are often generated during long-range PCR, can interfere with phasing algorithms and lead to inaccurate results.
